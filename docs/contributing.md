# Contributing to Parslet Docs

Thank you for improving the documentation! To build the HTML docs locally run:

```bash
make -C docs html
```

The rendered pages will appear under `docs/build/html`.

To run the project's tests execute:

```bash
pytest
```

Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
