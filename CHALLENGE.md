# Parslet Showcase Challenge

This repository is our submission for the **Africa Deep Tech Challenge 2025**.
Parslet demonstrates offline-first task scheduling for edge devices. It features
battery-aware execution, a fallback mode for low resources and a three-level
DEFCON security system. Parslet works well on Termux and includes adapters for
Parsl and Dask syntax. Recent updates include a compatibility guide and
automated CLI tests.

Our goal is to impress Parsl maintainers by showing how Parslet tasks can be
seamlessly converted to Parsl apps when HPC resources are available while still
running efficiently without internet access.
