# Our Story for the Africa Deep Tech Challenge 2025

Welcome! This is our project: **Parslet**. It’s a special tool we built to solve a problem that we, and many developers like us across Africa, face every day.

## The Big Idea: What if Your Phone Was All You Needed?

Innovation is happening everywhere, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns. But the tools to build and create often assume you have a powerful laptop, a super-fast internet connection, and a power outlet that never fails.

We know that's not the reality for everyone.

Many of us are learning, building, and dreaming on a smartphone with Termux, or a tiny Raspberry Pi in a field. We've all felt the frustration when the internet cuts out, or the battery warning flashes right when we're in the middle of something important.

Most professional software tools are built for the cloud. They're not built for us.

So we asked a simple question: **What if we could build a tool that lets anyone create powerful, automated software "recipes," even on a basic Android phone, completely offline?**

## Meet Parslet: Your Offline-First Workflow Assistant

Parslet is our answer. It’s a small, smart Python tool that lets you write down a list of software tasks and runs them for you, in the right order, on almost any device you have.

For this challenge, we want to share the features we built into Parslet that make it perfect for the place we call home:

-   **It Works Offline, Period:** No internet? No problem. Parslet runs your entire to-do list locally on your device.
-   **It's Smart About Battery:** Parslet can see when your device is low on power and will automatically slow down to save energy, like a phone in power-saver mode.
-   **It Adapts to Your Device:** It checks how much memory and processing power you have and adjusts itself to run as smoothly as possible, without causing your device to freeze or crash.
-   **It Has Security Guards:** We built in a "DEFCON" security system to protect you from common errors and bad code, because everyone deserves to be safe online and offline.
-   **It Plays Well with the Big Kids:** We know that sometimes you *do* get access to a powerful computer. When that happens, Parslet has tools that let you "graduate" your recipes to run on the big, industrial-strength systems like **Parsl** and **Dask** without having to rewrite everything.

## Our Dream for Parslet

Our dream is to show the world that a tool designed for someone on a phone in a remote village doesn't have to be a "lesser" tool.

With Parslet, you can build and test a life-changing automated workflow on your phone while sitting under a tree, and then, when you're ready, scale it up to run on a supercomputer.

We believe in building bridges:
-   A bridge between offline and online.
-   A bridge between your phone and the cloud.
-   And most importantly, a bridge between brilliant developers and the tools they need to change the world, no matter where they are.

Thank you for listening to our story.
