# Parslet Environment Setup Script for Termux
# -------------------------------------------
# This script automates the setup of the necessary environment
# and dependencies for running Parslet and its examples on Termux.
#
# IMPORTANT PRE-REQUISITES:
# 1. Termux Installation: Ensure you have Termux installed (preferably from F-Droid for up-to-date versions).
# 2. Project Directory: This script ASSUMES it is being run from the ROOT DIRECTORY
#    of your cloned Parslet project. This is crucial for:
#    a. Correctly creating the virtual environment (e.g., in './.venv-parslet').
#    b. Finding 'requirements.txt' for installing Python dependencies.
#    c. Installing Parslet itself (e.g., 'pip install -e .').
# 3. Executable Permissions: Make this script executable before running. If you are in
#    the project root, you might run: chmod +x parslet/termux/setup.sh
#    Then execute it from the project root: ./parslet/termux/setup.sh
